	Hello, here is some text without a meaning. This text should show what a printed text will look like
at this place. If you read this text, you will get no information. Really? Is there no information?
Is there a difference between this text and some nonsense like “Huardest gefburn”? Kjift – not at
all! A blind text like this gives you information about the selected font, how the letters are written
and an impression of the look. This text should contain all letters of the alphabet and it should be
written in of the original language. There is no need for special content, but the length of words
should match the language.

Hello, here is some text without a meaning. This text should show what a printed text will look like

and an impression of the look. This text should contain all letters of the alphabet and it should be

It also shows that citations work in fluent text \cite{lit:koblergraphisomorphism}

\paragraph{Paragraph - Formulas}
This is a regular formula $ x^{2 \pi}$ and a formula with a linebreak 
\[ \min_{\mathbf{Q}} \sum_i \left\| \mathbf{A}_i \mathbf{Q} - \mathbf{P}_i(\mathbf{A}_i \mathbf{Q}) \right\|^2_\mathrm{F} \]
Another option:
$$
x = -\frac{p}{2} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{p}{2})^2 -q}
$$

Or also as a numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
	x = -\frac{p}{2} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{p}{2})^2 -q}
\end{equation}

Or in alignment with multiple equations:
\begin{align*}
	\psi(x,y) = [lfp R, v. &(v = y) \vee \\
        &(V_0 v \wedge \exists v' (Evv' \wedge Rv')) \vee\\
        &(V_1 v \wedge \forall v' (Evv' \rightarrow Rv'))](y)
\end{align*}

\[F(X) = \begin{cases}
	A & \mbox{ for } X = \emptyset\\
	X & \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

Something fancy:
\begin{align*}
	\pi  &= \overbrace{11}^{x_0}|\overbrace{0}^{x_1}|\overbrace{101}^{x_2}|\overbrace{100 0}^{x_3}|\overbrace{101}^{x_4}|\overbrace{00 0}^{x_5}|\overbrace{1}^{x_6}|\ldots\\
	\pi' &= \underbrace{11}_{x_0'}|\underbrace{1 010}_{x_1'}|\underbrace{011}_{x_2'}|\underbrace{1 010}_{x_3'}|\underbrace{11}_{x_4'}|\underbrace{1 0}_{x_5'}|\ldots
\end{align*}

and with some text in same row:
\begin{equation*}
    w^T \phi(x) + b =0 \quad \Rightarrow \text{Nonlinear Classifier in} \; R^D
\end{equation*}

\section{Some drawing and tables}
A simple automaton drawn with tikz nodes.\\ 
\begin{tikzpicture}
	[state/.style ={draw, circle, inner sep = 0pt}]
			\node[state] (0) at (0,0) {$0$};
			\node[state] (1) at (3,0) {$1$};
			\path[->] (0) edge[loop above, font = \footnotesize] node {1,2,3,4,5,7} (0)
				edge[bend left, font = \footnotesize] node[above] {6} (1)
				(1) edge[loop above] node[font = \footnotesize,above] {1,2,4,5,6,7} (1)
				edge[bend left] node[font = \footnotesize, below] {3} (0);
    \end{tikzpicture}

A table containing some information:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
		\ & $\ell$ & $r$\\
		\hline
		$t$ & $(0, 0)$ & $(0, 0)$\\
		\hline
		$b$ & $(0, 0)$ & $(1, 1)$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
And an annotated table:
\[ \begin{blockarray}{ c c c c}
	& denied & granted & \sum \\
	\begin{block}{ c(cc)c }
	  protected & a & b &  n_{p}  \\
	  unprotected & c & d & n_{u} \\
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{c c c c}
		\sum & m_d & m_g & n\\
	\end{block}
  \end{blockarray}\]%

Plotting can also be done in a tikz environment:\\
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale = 0.6]
	\begin{axis}[every axis plot post/.append style={
		mark=none,domain=1:10,samples=50,smooth},
	  axis x line*=bottom, % no box around the plot, only x and y axis
	  axis y line*=left, % the * suppresses the arrow tips
	  ylabel = {$Pr(\lambda' = x)$},
	  xtick={5},
	  minor xtick={2,4,...,10},
	  xticklabels = {$\lambda$},
	  grid = major, ymajorgrids = false,
	  x tick label style={black},
	  enlarge y limits={abs value=.15, upper}, ]
	  \addplot {gauss(5,0.75)};
	  \legend{Distribution of the sample mean}
	\end{axis}
	\pgftransformshift{\pgfpoint{10cm}{0cm}}
	\begin{axis}[every axis plot post/.append style={
		mark=none,domain=1:10,samples=50,smooth},
		axis x line*=bottom, % no box around the plot, only x and y axis
		axis y line*=left, % the * suppresses the arrow tips
		ylabel = {$Pr(\lambda' = x)$},
		xtick={3.33,5},
		minor xtick={2,4,...,10},
		xticklabels = {$\frac{2}{3}\lambda$,$\lambda$},
		grid = major, ymajorgrids = false,
		x tick label style={black},
		enlarge y limits={abs value=.15, upper}, ]
		\addplot[color = red] {gauss(5*0.666,0.75)};
		\legend{Mixed strategy}
	  \end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
